        <h3>Journey started towards it.....</h3>
        <p>The journey of this sketch started from our online internal practical of PPS on <strong>30/07/2021</strong>.During 
        my practical he took a screenshot of mine and asked me  <em>Can I make your sketch of this photo.</em> That time 
    I thought that it is a joke. but after a 2 months I surprised 😨 when he told that your sketch is ready. </p>

       <h3>Finally the day comes......</h3>
       <p>I was so excited for my sketch and it was decided between us that at 6'Oclock he will give my sketch.
        <em>"jab we met"😜</em>, after a long time discussion and request finally he was ready to give my sketch.
        I can't explain What the time was......I was so happy.I could not explain my happiness and thanx to him.
        I had no words for that.As usual he put a condition in order to give my sketch....🤦‍♀️ that he will give my sketch
        if I go for ice-cream with him . and I sad <em>"DII SE PUCHH KR BTATI HU PLZZZ....."</em>🤦‍♀️😂🤣😂🤣

    <P>BY:- Utkarsh Johari<br></br>
        when i first saw varsha during the PPS viva,she was looking so cute and like ke "KISI NE MAARKR BAITHAYA H0" so i decided to take the screenshot of her so i can tease her later and then i decided that i'll ask her "can i make a sketch of yours by using this pic".she thought that it was a joke and she said "Yes".But i decided to make it real so i started work on it ,, ofcourse i choose the best pic of her and not that funny one and finally after 2 months the sketch was ready.I enjoyed a lot making it and when the sketch was ready it was looking fab. So i decided that i'll give this to her on her b'day,but that was the time of covid and we were at our homes bcoz of online classes,that was the time we fight daily and we can say every minute,I remembered the day I was preparing a frame for this sketch and  we again fight on a topic and we didn't talk or text each other for 3 days . After 3 days  I text her and she replied only "hii" for my 3-4 lines msg. So in anger i told her that i tore that sketch, she was so upset for this and she keeps on assuming that it was a joke,but.......no one knows FUTURE.!!!
